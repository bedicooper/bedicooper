# Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I specialize in frontend development in JavaScript, primarily working within React framework with Router and Redux Toolkit.<br>
Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning TypeScript and TanStack Query.<br>
Looking ahead, I am eager to delve into backend development with Node.js, aiming to become a well-rounded full-stack and SaaS developer.<br>
My goal is to gain proficiency in both font and backend technologies, ultimately delivering comprehensive and scalable solutions for modern web applications.
